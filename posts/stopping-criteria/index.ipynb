    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chat models can easily over-generate tokens\n",
    "- Setting `max_new_tokens` or similar parameters puts a hard stop on generation, but sometimes there is no 'one size fits all' maximum length\n",
    "- `StoppingCriteria` solves this problem by allowing you to check if a stop condition is met after each generated token\n",
    "- Little documentation exists for `StoppingCriteria`, so this article shows how to easily implement one and exactly how it works\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You ask an LLM a simple question. Somewhere in its 6+ paragraph response is the correct answer. It starts answering questions you didn't ask. It overexplains itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're paying, and waiting, for every token. You can't just set `max_new_tokens=100` because you don't know if the correct response is 20 or 200 tokens long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `max_new_tokens` and similar parameters can actually induce errors. Say you want an LLM to generate a JSON object. With no generation limits you can get a correctly written JSON object ruined by some unnecessary closing statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# You asked for JSON output\n",
    "prompt = \"Summarize this movie. Write your output in JSON with 'summary' and 'genres' keys...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# You get:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"summary\": \"A young couple's car breaks down near a castle, where they search for help.\",\n",
    "  \"genres\": [\"musical\", \"comedy\", \"horror\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this movie...[3 more paragraphs of explanation you didn't ask for]\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But setting a hard limit on number of tokens could be even worse, cutting off the JSON object before it's complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"summary\": \"Brad and Janet find their hometown Denton transformed into a TV studio.\",\n",
    "  \"genres\": [\"musical\", \"comedy\", \"sci-fi\",\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So in many cases there is no 'one size fits all' maximum length.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could let a model generate without constraint and then truncate the response. This can improve the user experience but doesn't save the time or computation cost from over-generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter `StoppingCriteria`. This object allows you to access the completion as the model generates each token and add any stopping conditions you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: A Long-Winded Mistral\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll instantiate [Mistral 7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) and give it a chat message to complete. Look at the output, particularly _after_ the assistant's response:\n"

    "### Using StoppingCriteria to Prevent Over-Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can parse out the assistant message, it would be better if we could actually stop generating tokens once we hit that `<|im_start|>user` marker. This is precisely what `StoppingCriteria` are for in the HuggingFace `transformers` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In a nutshell**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- a `StoppingCriteria` subclass implements a predicate (a boolean function) the model invokes after each token generated, stopping once the predicate returns `True`. \n",
    "- The predicate gets implemented as the `__call__` method\n",
    "- You can add any other attributes to track state in `__init__` or however you like\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems the `StoppingCriteria` designers intend for you to put one or more `StoppingCriteria` objects into a `StoppingCriteriaList`, and pass this in to a model's `generate` call. By default it stops generation if any of the criteria return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can implement a custom `StoppingCriteria`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subclass `StoppingCriteria` and implement the `__call__` method\n",
    "2. The `__call__` method takes the `input_ids` (tensor of all tokens generated so far) and `scores` (logits of the last generated token) and returns `True` when you want to stop generation, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "3. The call optionally accepts `**kwargs` which the model emits if you add `return_dict_in_generate=True` to your `generate` call.\n",
    "4. Because this is a class, you can define an `__init__` with any attributes you want to track state.\n",
